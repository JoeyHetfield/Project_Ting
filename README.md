# Project Ting

### Description
This project simulates the document indexing algorithm similar to Google's. It allows users to attach text files and perform search operations on those files.

With the vast amount of information available on the web, finding what you need would be nearly impossible without any assistance in organizing it. 
Google's classification systems organize hundreds of billions of web pages in the search index to provide the most useful and relevant results in a fraction of a second. Additionally, Google also focuses on presenting the results in a way that helps users find what they are looking for with even more ease.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a program that enables users to attach text files and perform search operations on them, similar to an indexing algorithm. The program will consist of two main modules: the File Management module and the Search module.
